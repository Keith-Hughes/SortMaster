# SortMaster
SortMaster is a simple file sorting GTK application built with Python and GTK 3.0. It allows users to organize files by specifying a target directory, a destination folder, and a pattern string. Files in the target directory that match the specified pattern are moved to the destination folder, making file management a breeze.
